Here’s a refined version with a more professional and impactful tone:

Big Picture Thinking - Proficient (Java, Angular, Spring Boot Applications)
	1.	Full-Stack Architecture Awareness – Designs and implements scalable applications by balancing responsibilities between Angular (frontend), Spring Boot (backend), and databases.
	2.	Microservices & Modular Design – Structures applications into well-defined microservices or modular monoliths to enhance scalability, maintainability, and reusability.
	3.	Efficient API Design & Integration – Develops RESTful and GraphQL APIs that optimize data exchange between Angular and Spring Boot, ensuring minimal latency.
	4.	State Management & Performance Optimization – Utilizes lazy loading, caching, and reactive programming (RxJS, WebFlux) to improve application performance.
	5.	Security Best Practices – Implements robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (JWT, OAuth, Okta, Keycloak) while securing APIs against common vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection).
	6.	Database & Query Optimization – Designs efficient database schemas, optimizes queries (JPA, Hibernate, Native SQL), and ensures proper indexing for faster data retrieval.
	7.	DevOps & CI/CD Awareness – Integrates automated build, test, and deployment pipelines (GitLab CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes) to streamline application delivery.
	8.	Cross-Platform & Responsive UI – Develops Angular applications with seamless cross-device compatibility, prioritizing UX, accessibility, and performance.
	9.	Scalability & Load Handling – Ensures applications can handle high traffic and data loads by leveraging asynchronous processing, caching, and load balancers.
	10.	Observability & Logging – Implements centralized logging (ELK, Prometheus, Grafana) and monitoring to proactively detect and resolve application issues.

This version removes “I” and presents the points in a more structured and professional manner. Let me know if you’d like any further refinements!
