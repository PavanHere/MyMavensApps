Here are proficiency-related testing points tailored to your applications, which include collection and recovery activities, auditing external vendors, security, and infrastructure applications:

Proficiency in Testing for Your Applications

1. Backend Testing (Cucumber & Serenity)
	•	Auditing & Compliance Validation – Uses Cucumber and Serenity to automate audit workflows, ensuring external vendor activities comply with regulatory and business rules.
	•	Collection & Recovery Data Validation – Tests backend logic for transaction accuracy, account reconciliation, and case management workflows.
	•	Security & Access Control Testing – Ensures role-based access control (RBAC) and authentication mechanisms function correctly across different user roles.
	•	API Contract & Integration Testing – Automates REST API tests to validate integrations with payment gateways, notification systems, and internal services.

2. Frontend Testing (Jest for Angular Applications)
	•	User Journey Validation – Uses Jest to validate user interactions for internal auditors reviewing vendor activities and collection agents handling recovery cases.
	•	Component-Level Testing – Ensures reusable Angular components (e.g., dashboards, reporting tools, and input forms) function as expected across different applications.
	•	Error Handling & UI Security Tests – Tests user permissions, session handling, and secure data rendering for compliance and security applications.

3. Infrastructure & DevOps Testing
	•	CI/CD Pipeline Test Automation – Integrates Jest, Cucumber, and Serenity into the in-house CI/CD pipeline to ensure test execution before deployments.
	•	Performance & Load Testing – Simulates high traffic to verify that collection and auditing applications handle large volumes of transactions efficiently.
	•	Observability & Monitoring Tests – Validates logging mechanisms (ELK, OpenTelemetry) and security alert triggers for compliance and security applications.

4. Security & Compliance Testing
	•	Audit Trail Verification – Tests audit logs and event tracking to ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance in vendor audits and recovery case management.
