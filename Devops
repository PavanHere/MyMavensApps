Here are Big Picture Thinking points for DevOps applications using OpenShift and an in-house pipeline:

Big Picture Thinking - Proficient (DevOps & Application Deployment)
	1.	Containerized Deployment Strategy – Designs and deploys applications using OpenShift, ensuring efficient container orchestration, resource allocation, and scalability.
	2.	CI/CD Pipeline Optimization – Configures and maintains an in-house CI/CD pipeline to automate builds, testing, and deployments, improving software delivery speed and reliability.
	3.	Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Leverages Helm charts and Kubernetes configurations to manage infrastructure declaratively, ensuring consistency and ease of deployment.
	4.	Security & Compliance Integration – Implements security best practices, such as vulnerability scanning, access controls, and automated compliance checks, to maintain a secure deployment pipeline.
	5.	Performance & Scalability Management – Optimizes application performance by fine-tuning OpenShift resource limits, horizontal/vertical scaling, and load balancing strategies.
	6.	Observability & Monitoring – Integrates logging (ELK stack), monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana), and alerting mechanisms to proactively detect and resolve infrastructure or application issues.
	7.	Automated Testing & Quality Assurance – Ensures robust automated testing (unit, integration, performance) is incorporated into the pipeline to maintain high-quality releases.
	8.	Zero-Downtime Deployments – Implements blue-green and rolling deployment strategies on OpenShift to minimize downtime and ensure seamless releases.
	9.	Optimized Resource Utilization – Continuously monitors resource consumption and optimizes OpenShift configurations to balance cost and performance efficiency.
	10.	Disaster Recovery & Failover Planning – Designs and maintains backup, failover, and rollback strategies to ensure high availability and resilience in production environments.
